# ManorScripts
A list of TypeScript and JavaScript snippets I use across my projects.

## What this is?
Across several of my projects I've been repeating code for several years. Most of my code was named after or inspired
by my loving girlfriend and friends. This repository will be used to store this information and both [JavaScript](https://github.com/YourNetworkNerd/ManorScripts/tree/master/JavaScript) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/YourNetworkNerd/ManorScripts/tree/master/TypeScript) version of both.

The [TypeScript](https://github.com/YourNetworkNerd/ManorScripts/tree/master/TypeScript) folder is coded raw.
The [JavaScript](https://github.com/YourNetworkNerd/ManorScripts/tree/master/JavaScript) is compiled TypeScript.
